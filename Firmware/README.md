# Firmware to drive the motor qwiic motor and required code
The code to run the motor driver for a biloar stepper is provided in **motor_driver.py** <br />
Usage: `python motor_driver_updated.py` <br />
**NOTE** <br />
The libraries above are required to run the code, inside back-ups are avaliable, <br />
and instructions on how they should be installed for testing
<br />
## Libraries
These libraries contain the base components along with references, these being: <br />
- I2C libraries for the qwiic connections
- Motor driver library in order to make the motor run
- Backup of the libraries themselves from their github repo <br />

## Debug
This is standard code to test the rasp pi pins and GPIO, simply used to test the PCB connections. <br />
